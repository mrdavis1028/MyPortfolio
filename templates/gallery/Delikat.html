                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p class="gallery-item-text">The goal of this design was to adhere to the guidelines of the client, my professor, in this case. We had to make a strictly typographic logo for the brand as well as incorporate scandinavian geometric design patterns in some way or fashion. In addition, we had to come up with exactly three variations for three pre-selected flavors of juice. Lastly, the designs had to appeal to our target market which were younger professionals who wanted fresh juice and upscale branding.</p>

                <h1 >Process</h1>
                <p class="gallery-item-text">My process involved a few rounds of ideation, singling out about 20-30 sketches into a finalized logo and eventual package design. From there I generated the final mockup which you can see above. My main struggles were trying to focus on strictly type and geometry to convey the themes of the company, with little to no reliance on illustration. However, I surmounted this obstacle and was very pleased with the result.</p>

                <h1>Outcome(s)</h1>
                <p class="gallery-item-text">The main outcome was more confidence in my ability to use type to convey feeling without using any illustration or well-known symbols. I also had a lot of fun coming up with the designs I used on the bottle using very primitive shapes like circles, lines, and triangles.</p>
